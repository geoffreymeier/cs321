BTree Layout on Disk
  For our BTree, we started by saving the metadata.
            Data              #Bytes
        1. sequence length : 1 byte
        2. degree(t)       : 4 bytes (int)
        3. root pointer    : 8 bytes (long)
  Then we went on to add all the BTree Nodes.
        4+. BTreeNodes     : 13 + 8(2t+1) + 12(2t-1) bytes
        
  For our BTreeNodes, we started by saving the boolean isLeaf and int numKeys variables.
            Data              #Bytes
        1. isLeaf          : 1 byte
        2. numKeys         : 4 bytes        (int)
  Then, we added the long pointers of the node.
        3. self pointer    : 8 bytes        (long)
        4. parent pointer  : 8 bytes        (long)
        5. child pointers  : 8(2t) bytes    (array of longs with size of 2t)
  Then, we added the TreeObjects.
        6+. TreeObjects    : 12(2t-1) bytes (array of TreeObjects with size of 2t-1)
        
  For our TreeObjects, we saved the long key and the frequency.
            Data          #Bytes
        1. key        :  8 bytes (long)
        2. frequency  :  4 bytes (int)
